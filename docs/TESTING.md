### Test cases (user story based with screenshots)

**1. As a First Time Visitor, I want to immediately understand the main purpose of the site and if I belong to the audience it targets.**
As the visitor enters the web page, they are greeted with a video of a pregnant woman doing gentle exercises sitting on a pilates ball. This video should resonate with the target audience of pregnant women and it shows that they can do exercises in their own home with equipment they most likely already have. The tag lines of Fitness, Wellbeing, Connection, and Strength tell the visitor that the web site offers a complete program, not just physical exercises.

**2. I want to be able to easily navigate throughout the website in order to find out more about the workout program and its benefits.**
The visitor can access the entire website available to them just by scrolling downwards. For laptop screen sizes, there is a downward pointing arrow to get them started. Single page websites are common and the visitor is likely familiar with this format. The fixed website header has a quick navigation menu that appears when hovering over the header. Many visits will find this menu, but even if they don't, the website is still usable by simply scrolling the page.

**3. I want to find the subscription plan options, what features they include and their respective pricing.**
The two different plans (Basic and Premium) are compared right after the section that explains the offering. The two plans are laid out so that the visitor can directly compare them point by point to see which one is a better fit for them. The price is indicated at the bottom of the comparison chart, right before the buttons to select plan. This whole section includes a screenshot from the mobile app, with links to the iOS and Android app stores, to further entice them to sign up to one of the subscription plans.

**4. I want to be able to subscribe for a free trial period.**
When the visitor compares the Basic and Premium subscription plans, the first point in the charts is letting them know that they can test either of the plans, with a seven day trial period. The signup page is not included in this project, which is where they would be informed about the conditions of the trial period, before entering their information and creating an account.


**5. I want to be able to get in touch with the company, in order to address any questions that I may have.**
The form to contact the company is available right on the front page, by scrolling to the bottom of the page or by clicking on the quick navigation link. Based on the visitor's previous experiences with other websites, they should intuitively look towards the bottom of the page for contact information, but in this case they will directly find the contact form itself.

**6. I want to find the links to their social media pages.**
The visitor is likely to look for the standard social media icons (Facebook, Instagram, etc.) in either the header or the footer of the page. They will find the icons in the footer, by scrolling to the bottom of the page. This will require some effort from the visitor, but navigating away from the website is not the main action that should be promoted, signing up for one of the plans is.

**7. I want to sign up for their newsletter, in case there is a special discount to join the program at a lower rate.**
This visitor will also find the newsletter signup in the footer of the page. This should be familiar as many websites have their newsletter signup in the footer. Some websites also promotes the newsletter using modal subscription popup dialogs, but while this may drive more traffic to the newsletter, it is not necessarily as beneficial to business as it would be for an e-commerce website, where emails with discount codes will drive a lot of the traffic. Instead of driving visitors to the newsletter, the focus is on getting them to sign up to a plan.
