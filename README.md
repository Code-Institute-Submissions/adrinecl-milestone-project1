## About the Website

"Paus" is a website intended for expecting and new mothers who wish to have an active and healthy pregnancy and postpartum recovery of the body and mind. This website is targeted towards women who are looking for safe at-home prenatal and postpartum workouts. This website is extremely relevant during times such as the COVID-19 pandemic, when unfortunately expecting and postpartum women are part of the risk group, making online fitness instructions a good alternative during self-isolation and lockdown times. 

The name "Paus" comes from Swedish and it has several alternative translations and interpretations that are all fitting to this project. It can mean a "waiting period", which every pregnancy is in its essence. It can be to "take a break" and have some time for oneself to focus on their own wellbeing, which is essential for busy mothers. It also relates to "pausing" when it is important to take it slow and listen to your body in times of stress or postpartum recovery.

By subscribing to the website, women can choose between on-demand and live stream safe workouts curated specially for each stage of pregnancy. The workout are mainly inpired by yoga, pilates and calisthenics, as well as other activities such as meditation guidance, relaxation tips, mini courses for labor preparation and other relevant information. The live streams are a great way to socialize and keep themselves fit.

## Strategy

### Project Goals
The purpose of this project is to build a static front-end site, using mainly HTML5 and CSS3. The website should provide enough data in an aesthetically pleasing manner, while helping users achieve their goals. In this project, the main goal is to make sure that the user learns about a workout program for expecting and postpsartum mothers offered by the fictional company "Paus" and joins one of the subscription plans. Therefore, the project can create value for both the customers and the company, by providing an interesting and valuable product/service for the user and generating income for the company.

### Business Goals
The main goal of the website is to increase sales of subscriptions to attract paid members and keep existing members by having a website with enough information for a visitor to see value and make a decision to join. This is the first ever developed website for "Paus".

Audience: the website target English-speaking expecting or postpartum mothers in the age range 18-45 worldwide, since all classed are available online both on-demand and live stream, depending on the subscription plan. The target audience has busy schedules. Currently they are looking for alternatives to stay active at home due to self isolation / lockdown due to the current COVID-19 pandemic, since pregnant and postpartum women are part of a risk group.

### Customer Goals
Prospective members / first website visitors: get to know the company "Paus" and the benefits of the workout program, compare plans and potentially subscribe to one of the options. 

In the future, after development of the members-only section, the existing members will wish to access the program through the website.

## Scope


## Structure

## Skeleton
### Wireframes

- A first draft was sketched by hand on paper and then Balsamiq was used for the final wireframes.
![Balsamiq wireframes](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/adrinecl/milestone-project1/master/docs/wireframes/paus-wireframe.png).

## Surface
### Design

#### Color Scheme

- The colors chosen were dusk rose, beige, sage and dark green. See ![Color Palette](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/adrinecl/milestone-project1/master/docs/Paus%20-%20Color%20Palette.png) here.
- These colors were chosen to represent the following keywords, respectively: feminine, minimalist, calm and nature. They evoke a sense of elegance and appeal to an upscale audience.

#### Typography

#### Imagery

- The photos and videos used should be high quality and modern, while conveying a sense of warmth and comfort. This way it can depict that the workout program can be easily done at home. The videos and photos should portray expecting mothers exercising, meditating and just a sense of wellbeing that they are fully enjoying their pregnancies.
